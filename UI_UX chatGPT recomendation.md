CRITERIA EVALUATION:

Clear problem & solution: PASS EVIDENCE: "One-handed flying Snake for commuters"

Technically feasible: PASS EVIDENCE: "One-handed flying Snake"

Target audience identified: PASS EVIDENCE: "for commuters and hyper-casual players"

FINAL VERDICT: APPROVED

This idea satisfies all criteria. It presents a clear solution (a specific control scheme and game type) to an implied problem (the need for easy, single-handed entertainment during travel). The technical requirements for a hyper-casual arcade game are well-established and achievable. Finally, it explicitly identifies "commuters" and "hyper-casual players" as the primary demographics.

FINAL IDEA: SkySnake — One-handed flying Snake for commuters and hyper-casual players

Would you like me to help you outline the core gameplay mechanics or a monetization plan for this concept?
